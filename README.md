class project
To establish a portfolio of work, I have submitted a C++ project.  
The project is for a pretend company that wants sales information on produce items to reset the layout for customer convenience.
The code is well thought out in its effort to valid input and run no matter what the user does.  
The code could become enhanced with advanced knowledge of C++, there are probably preexisting tools out there that could be used.  A better usage of tools would make the code run faster with less demand.
The most challenging part was figuring out when to use maps.  I brought them in halfway, and if I had started with them the entire project would have gone easier.
The skills that I find most transferable are organization.  If you don't have a clear understanding of the project, you end up rewriting the entire project halfway through.  It's like wasting time, except you learn from it.
The program uses an abundance of comments for comprehension and follows standard guidelines to the best of my current ability.
